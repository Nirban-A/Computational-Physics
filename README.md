# Computational-Physics

I am trying to make a repo containing different methods used in computational physics. It will consist of algorithm, explanation and code of that method.

Primarily I am going to write the codes in python. Later will upload both C and Julia version of the codes.

Books: - Scientific Computing in Python, Abhijit Kar Gupta
